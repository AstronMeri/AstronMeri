# Aaron Bediako

I'm Aaron — a software engineer who enjoys building things that *just work*. I mostly work with **C# (.NET)** and **Node.js**, and I’m currently deep in the world of backend services, banking tech, and AI bots.

🚀 I'm currently working on side projects that mix **AI**, **automation**, and **a bit of chaos** (like a meme bot for Ghanaian Twitter 😅).  
🔍 I’m obsessed with clean architecture, scalable code, and solving annoying problems with simple tools.  
📚 Always learning.
